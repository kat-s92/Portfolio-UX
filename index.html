            With the help of SheCodes I managed to stay motivated throughout Corona lockdown and completed a coding

            (html, css, JS, React) and got a good insight into front-end development. They really work, you can give

        <p>
            Searching and booking flights can be overwhelming! <br />Navigating clunky apps and websites is confusing
            and frustrating.
            The main objective of this project was to design an intuitive product that focused on the needs of it's
            users and made their journey more efficient.

        <h1>1. Research</h1>
        <p>First thing is first - in order to solve a problem, I needed to <strong>identify</strong> it.
            The first step of this project was to conduct extensive research into the flight booking space and it's
            users.
            <br /><br /><strong> The main questions I wanted answered were as follows:</strong> <br /><br /> - What
            existing solutions are out there for users?
            <br />- What are users' goals while using flight booking sites?<br />- What do users like and where do their
            frustrations lie with the sites they use?
            <br /><br />Methods I used to find the answers - <a href="#Competitive Benchmarking">Competitive

            solutions
            of
            some current industry leaders allowed me to see what already
            exists out there, to identify a few obvious conventions and also some painpoints all of which I took
            onbaord
            for my own design later.<br />
            <br />I compared the following three airlines and one aggregator, focusing on three main features
            <strong>Homepage, Search, Select. </strong>

            I did a deep dive of each homepage - it's visual design and functionality and
            marked those features that I
            found to be positive in green and those to be negative in red. I found that all homepages followed some
            convensions and had many things in
            common.

            Carrying out the survey helped to gather some quantitative data and get a better understanding of user

            for how users <strong>feel</strong> about the flight booking experience and the websites/apps that they
            currently use. I asked mostly closed-ended questions but also wanted to give the option to write a short

            total
            price/add-ons, too much irrelevant information eg.promotions/upselling, need for easier access to

            <span class="sub-heading">1.3 Usability Testing</span><br /><br />
            Conducting usability testing helped me to get a deep insight into user behaviour while they flow
            through
            the
            process of booking a flight in real time. It was an excellent exercise to see what actions they took, to
            understand why they took them
            and how they felt about their user journey.<br /><br /><span class="sub-heading">My
                Findings</span><br /><br />
            I carried out usability tests on two different flight booking sites - Aar Lingus and Eurowings. As well as
            that I watched usability tests of two other participants to gather more information.

        <h1>2. Analysis</h1>
        <p class="analysis-intro">After collecting the data it was time to review and make sense of it, to
            <strong>categorise</strong> the
            findings and to make a more structured overview of the user problem. This was done by creating an <a

                Affinity
                Diagram

            I worked together with another designer on an a very detailed affinity map. We shared our research data with
            each other and noted our observations on post-its. After combining all of them togther, we grouped them
            togther according to different patterns that we began to see emerging. Each sub group received a name.
            </br /></br />We
            came up with 25 groups in total, some of the main groups were - mental models that hinder good user
            experience (friction), mental
            models that aid good user experience, pre-booking behaviours, error recovery, communcation between
            passengers.</br /></br /> You can see more of the affinity map groups <a

            I took the grouped information from the affinity map and arranged into a step-by-step journey. Along each
