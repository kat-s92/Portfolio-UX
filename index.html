            Searching and booking flights can be overwhelming! <br />Navigating clunky apps and websites is confusing
            and frustrating.
            The main objective of this project was to design an intuitive product that focused on the needs of it's
            users and made their journey more efficient.

            <strong>identify</strong> it.
            The first step of this project was to conduct extensive research into the flight booking space and it's
            users.
            <br /><br /><strong> The main questions I wanted answered were as follows:</strong> <br /><br /> - What
            existing solutions are out there for users?
            <br />- What are users' goals while using flight booking sites?<br />- What do users like and where do their
            frustrations lie with the sites they use?
            <br /><br />Methods I used to find the answers - <a href=" #Competitive Benchmarking">Competitive

            of
            some current industry leaders allowed me to see what already
            exists out there, to identify a few obvious conventions and also some painpoints all of which I took
            on board
            for my own design later.<br />
            <br />I compared the following three airlines and one aggregator, focusing on three main features
            <strong>Homepage, Search, Select. </strong>

            marked those features that I
            found to be positive in green and those to be negative in red. I found that all homepages followed some
            conventions and had many things in
            common.

            Conducting usability testing helped me to get a deep insight into user behaviour while they flow
            through
            the
            process of booking a flight in real time. It was an excellent exercise to see what actions they took, to
            understand why they took them
            and how they felt about their user journey.<br /><br /><span class="sub-heading">My
                Findings</span><br /><br />
            I carried out usability tests on two different flight booking sites - Aar Lingus and Eurowings. As well as
            that I watched usability tests of two other participants to gather more information.

        <h1>2. Analysis</h1>
        <p class="analysis-intro">After collecting the data it was time to review and make sense of it, to
            <strong>categorize</strong> the
            findings and to make a more structured overview of the user problem. This was done by creating an <a
                href="#affinity-diagram">
                Affinity
                Diagram
            </a> and <a href="#customer-journey-map">Customer Journey Map</a>.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p id="affinity-diagram"><span class="sub-heading">2.1 Affinity Diagram</span><br /><br />
            I worked together with another designer on an a very detailed affinity map. We shared our research data with
            each other and noted our observations on post-its. After combining all of them together, we grouped them
            together according to different patterns that we began to see emerging. Each sub group received a name.
            </br /></br />We
            came up with 25 groups in total, some of the main groups were - mental models that hinder good user
            experience (friction), mental
            models that aid good user experience, pre-booking behaviours, error recovery, communication between
            passengers.</br /></br /> You can see more of the affinity map groups <a href="pdf/affinity-map.pdf"

            I took the grouped information from the affinity map and arranged it in line with each step of the user
            journey. At each
            step I noted the goals, behaviours, pain points and positive reactions/feedback. <br />
            The map allowed me to get a more cohesive view of where friction occurred along the process, what had caused
            it and gave good insight into what users enjoyed about their experience.<br /> The top part of the CJM
            includes a
            mood map to visualize user's feelings towards the process at each step.

            Users often found themselves unsure of how to proceed to the next step, which indicates a <strong>lack of
                feedback and indicators</strong> poorly designed CTA's<br />

            Too many options and <strong>too much/unclear information is overwhelming</strong> and takes away from the
            user experience<br />

                style="color: darkblue; font-size: 30px;"></span>
            Everyone was <strong>used to different ways (mental models at work)</strong> of inputting information -
            typing/selecting and when their preferred
            method
            was unavailable, they were upset<br />
            <span class="iconify" data-inline="false" data-icon="bx:bx-right-arrow-circle"
                style="color: darkblue; font-size: 30px;"></span>
            Users preferred a <strong>clean design</strong> with lots of whitespace and some bright colours<br /><span

            Users found the presence of a Chatbot for quick customer support <strong>reassuring</strong>

        <h1>3. Design</h1>
        <p>
            Once I was done with the research analysis, it was time to begin designing my own solution. <br />I wanted
            to
            create an intuitive and communicative product with a focus on good user feedback from the system -
            useful
            error messages and actionable recovery tasks,
            clear CTA's and indicators and an overall friendly, polite software. <br /><br />
            The steps involved in the design stage were creating a clear <a href="#user-flow">
                User Flow
            </a>, sketching the <a href="#interaction-design">Interaction Design</a> and some
            Low Fidelity Wireframing.
        </p>
        <p id="user-flow"><span class="sub-heading">3.1 User Flow Diagram<br />üîó
                <a href=pdf/competitive-benchmark-analysis.pdf target="_blank">

                    More detailed version here</a></span><br /><br />
            Keeping in mind the pain-points and mental models that I took notes on, I put together a high level
            user flow diagram which represents how the user would interact with the system.<br />

        <div class="user-flow"><img src="images/user-flow.png" style="max-width:100%;height:auto;"></div>

                    Sketches</a></span><br /><br />
            The next step was to start putting my ideas on paper - I sketched what the screens would look like and how
            the user will
            interact with each feature on the page. <br /> Building on everything that I had learned up to that point
            and keeping to the current conventions I had a good idea of what I wanted the user experience to feel

                <div class="col-6"><strong>Navigation:</strong> Primary navigation on top right, visible at all

                    them focused on
                    the task and eliminate distractions <br /><br />
                    <strong>Linear Flow:</strong> Flow here is linear and I wanted the user to have the flexibility to
                    change
                    their flight requirements eg. luggage, number of passengers, flight class, at any time during the
                    journey
