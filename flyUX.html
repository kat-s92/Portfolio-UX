                <br /><br />
                Searching and booking flights can be overwhelming! <br />Navigating clunky apps and websites is
                confusing
                and frustrating.
                The main objective of this project was to design an intuitive product that focused on the needs
                of it's
                users and made their journey more efficient.

                on board
                for my own design later.<br />
                <br />I compared the following three airlines and one aggregator, focusing on three main features

                I did a deep dive of the Search ans Select steps of each airline - it's visual design and functionality
                and
                marked those features that I
                found to be positive in green and those to be negative in red. I found a lot of interesting stuff here,
                I
                really enjoyed some of the features and began to put together an idea of what I wanted my own
                site to look and feel like.

                After digging into the different booking processes myself, I turned to the users to
                learn about their experiences and habits around flight booking. <br /> <br /> I collected 15 survey
                responses, asked mostly
                closed-ended
                questions but also wanted to give the option to write a
                short
                phrase to find out some emotions.

                behaviours, perceptions and
                frustrations. This exercise also allowed me build on what I found while benchmarking by relating
                some of
                information from the survey to my existing findings.

                Conducting usability testing helped me to get a deep insight into user behaviour while they flow
                through
                the
                process of booking a flight in real time. It was an excellent exercise to observe what actions they
                took, to
                understand why they took them
                and how they felt about their user journey. <br /><br /><span class="sub-heading"
                    style="font-size:2.5vw">My
                    Findings</span><br /><br />
                I carried out a usability test on the Aer Lingus flight booking site and watched recorded usability
                tests of
                two other participants using the same site to gather more information. <br />This exercise
                was also a chance
                for me to compare my own experiences and perceptions (so far) of the flight booking process with
                those
                of
                different
                users. It put into perspective the power of mental mapping as well as the differences in digital
                literacy.

                categorize the
                findings and to make a more structured overview of the user problem. This was done by creating an <a

                    Affinity
                    Diagram

                For this part, I worked together with another designer who was working on the same project.
                Together, we
                created a
                very detailed affinity map by sharing research data
                with
                each other and noting our observations on post-its. After combining all of them together, we grouped
                them
                according to different patterns that we began to see emerging. Each sub group received a name.
                </br /></br />We
                came up with 25 groups in total, some of the main groups were - mental models that hinder good user
                experience (friction), mental
                models that aid good user experience, pre-booking behaviours, error recovery, communication between
                passengers.</br /></br /> You can see more of the affinity map groups <a href="pdf/affinity-map.pdf"

                The map allowed me to get a more cohesive view of where friction occurred along the process, what

                Once I analysed my research and made some conclusions, it was time to begin designing my own

                error messages and actionable recovery tasks,
                clear CTA's and indicators. I wanted the software to be friendly and polite, easy to navigate and
                feel
                smooth. <br /><br />
                The steps involved in the design stage were creating a clear <a href=" #user-flow">

                The next step was to start combining the user interactions with some visuals. At this stage a lot of
                ideas
                were formed and using pen
                and paper was a great way to experiment
                and make quick
                changes.<br />

            <h1>4. Prototype and Wireframe</h1>
            <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">I used Figma to design this mid fidelity prototype and the
                Beta version of interactive
                components to
                create
                and reuse
                some of the more complex interactions. I then used this prototype in the validation stage and it can
                be
                used
                to build upon
                over time and improved.<br /><br />

            <h1>5. Validation</h1>

            <p>

                I was able to gather evidence and feedback about the user journey that I created by testing my
                prototype. This feedback can be
                used to improve/re-design different features of the site. <br /> It was important to let the user
                know
                that this is a simulated site and that it has limited functionality. As well as asking them
                to complete the booking, I also asked some questions regarding the visuals and the emotions
                associated
                with it.
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                I was pretty happy with how this exercise went. The user went through the process with ease and they
                felt that they received good feedback/confirmation from the system. Their feedback about navigation
                and
                progress bar was positive and CTA's appeared to be clear. The user did not question where they
                needed to
                go next and did not express a need for more detailed info, which was one of the things I was very
                curious to test.
                <br />
                <br />
                This exercise proves very useful and from the very first step I could already see a small
                area for improvement, I also managed to take some notes throughout the process and take the user's
                ideas
                on board.
                If I were to add some re-designs, I would add prices to the date picker to make cost fluctuations
                more evident. I would also add a "Sign-In" option at the "Payment" step.

            <h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p>
                <span style="font-weight: 300;">What I learned</span> - I learned a number of things throughout this
                project, the main
                ones
                being how to conduct a usability test and the types of different research methods used in UX. I
                found
                the usability test particularly valuable to the project, it gave me a lot of information to work
                with
                and
                a confidence that I was solving a
                real problem.<br />The other very important thing I learned is that the user's mental maps will
                dictate
                their behaviour and that we need to try and understand those mental maps as best as possible.
                <br /><br />
                <span style="font-weight: 300;">What I would do differently</span> - I would change up my research
                strategy. I would try
                to
                collect a larger sample size for my surveys. I would also perhaps try to facilitate a focus group
                with
                some better-qualified interviewees. I would like to have asked more specific questions regarding
                some of
                the features currently used on flight booking sites/apps as well as user habits.<br />
