                Searching and booking flights can be overwhelming! <br />Navigating clunky apps and websites is
                confusing
                and frustrating.
                The main objective of this project was to design an intuitive product that focused on the needs of it's
                users and made their journey more efficient.

                <strong>identify</strong> it.
                The first step of this project was to conduct extensive research into the flight booking space and it's
                users.
                <br /><br /><strong> The main questions I wanted answered were as follows:</strong> <br /><br /> - What
                existing solutions are out there for users?
                <br />- What are users' goals while using flight booking sites?<br />- What do users like and where do
                their
                frustrations lie with the sites they use?
                <br /><br />Methods I used to find the answers - <a href=" #Competitive Benchmarking">Competitive

                some current industry leaders allowed me to see what already
                exists out there, to identify a few obvious conventions and also some painpoints all of which I took
                on board
                for my own design later.<br />
                <br />I compared the following three airlines and one aggregator, focusing on three main features
                <strong style="font-size:1.75vw">Homepage, Search, Select. </strong>

                I did a deep dive of the Search ans Select steps of each airline - it's visual design and functionality
                and
                marked those features that I
                found to be positive in green and those to be negative in red. I found a lot of interesting stuff here,
                I
                really enjoyed some of the features and began to put together an idea of what I wanted my own
                site to look and feel like.

                After digging into the different booking processes myself, it was time to turn to the users and
                learn about their own experiences with flight booking. <br />I had 15 people take my survey. I wanted to
                try
                and get an understanding
                for how users <strong>feel</strong> about the flight booking experience and the websites/apps that they
                currently use. I asked mostly closed-ended questions but also wanted to give the option to write a short
                phrase to find out some emotions.

                behaviours, perceptions and
                frustrations. This exercise also allowed me build on what I found while benchmarking by relating some of
                information from the survey to my existing findings.

                understand why they took them
                and how they felt about their user journey. <br /><br /><span class="sub-heading"

                I carried out a usability test on the Aer Lingus flight booking site and watched recorded usability
                tests of
                two other participants using the same site to gather more information. <br />This exercise
                was also a chance
                for me to compare my own experiences and perceptions (so far) of the flight booking process with those
                of
                different
                users. It put into perspective the power of mental mapping as well as the differences in digital

                For this part, I worked together with another designer who was working on the same project. Together, we
                created a
                very detailed affinity map by sharing research data
                with
                each other and noting our observations on post-its. After combining all of them together, we grouped
                them
                according to different patterns that we began to see emerging. Each sub group received a name.
                </br /></br />We
                came up with 25 groups in total, some of the main groups were - mental models that hinder good user
                experience (friction), mental
                models that aid good user experience, pre-booking behaviours, error recovery, communication between
                passengers.</br /></br /> You can see more of the affinity map groups <a href="pdf/affinity-map.pdf"

                step I noted the goals, behaviours, pain points and positive reactions/feedback. <br />
                The map allowed me to get a more cohesive view of where friction occurred along the process, what had
                caused
                it and gave good insight into what users enjoyed about their experience.<br /> The top part of the CJM

            <h1 style="font-size:2.5vw">3. Design</h1>
            <p style="font-size:1.75vw">
                Once I analysed my research and made some conclusions, it was time to begin designing my own solution.
                <br />I
                wanted
                to
                create a communicative product with a focus on feedback from the system to the user in the form of
                useful
                error messages and actionable recovery tasks,
                clear CTA's and indicators. I wanted the software to be friendly and polite, easy to navigate and feel
                smooth. <br /><br />
                The steps involved in the design stage were creating a clear <a href=" #user-flow">
                    User Flow</a> and some <a href="#interaction-design">Low Fidelity Sketching</a>.

                        More detailed version here</a></span><br /><br />
                Keeping in mind the pain-points and mental models that I took notes on, I put together a high level
                user flow diagram which represents how the user would interact with the system.<br />

                The next step was to start combining the user interactions with some visuals. At this stage a lot of
                ideas
                were formed and using pen
                and paper was a great way to experiment
                and make quick
                changes.<br />

            <h1>5. Validation</h1>

            <p>

                I was able to gather evidence and feedback about the user journey that I created by testing my
                prototype. This feedback can be
                used to improve/re-design different features of the site. <br /> It was important to let the user know
                that this is a simulated site and that it has limited functionality. As well as asking them
                to complete the booking, I also asked some questions regarding the visuals and the emotions associated
                with it.
                <br />

                <br />
                <br />
                I was pretty happy with how this exercise went. The user went through the process with ease and they
                felt that they received good feedback/confirmation from the system. Their feedback about navigation and
                progress bar was positive and CTA's appeared to be clear. The user did not question where they needed to
                go next and did not express a need for more detailed info, which was one of the things I was very
                curious to test.
                <br />
                <br />
                If I were to add some re-designs, I would add prices to the date picker to make cost fluctuations
                more evident. I would also add a "Sign-In" option at the "Payment" step.

            </p>
            <h1>Conclusions</h1>
            <p>
                <strong>What I learned</strong> - I learned a number of things throughout this project, the main ones
                being how to conduct a usability test and the types of different research methods used in UX. I found
                the usability test particularly valuable to the project, it gave me a lot of information to work with
                and
                a confidence that I was solving a
                real problem.<br />The other very important thing I learned is that the user's mental maps will dictate
                their behaviour and that we need to try and understand those mental maps as best as possible.
                <br /><br />
                <strong>What I would do differently</strong> - I would change up my research strategy. I would try to
                collect a larger sample size for my surveys. I would also perhaps try to facilitate a focus group with
                some better-qualified interviewees. I would like to have asked more specific questions regarding some of
                the features currently used on flight booking sites/apps as well as user habits.
