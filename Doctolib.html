            <br /><br />
            I was recently looking for a doctor in a new city and came across Doctolib - great service offered to
            patients. I enjoyed using their website but found
            that I did not have such a great user experience on the app. I had some of my own ideas that I wanted to
            test out and so I decided to redesign the "Search" feature of the Doctolib App.<br /><br />

        <h2>1.1 Understanding the Doctolib Problem</h2>
        <p>I examined the Homescreen first
            and then began to test the Search function to see what features are offered to the user.</p>

            Unfortunately, I found more negatives than positives in the Doctolib user experience, it did not feel
            like a
            very intuitive app to me. The good thing was that I had lots to work on!

        <h2>1.2 Benchmarking</h2>
        <p>
            I began to search for
            other doctor booking apps, focusing on the 'Search'
            capabilities, I
            wanted
            to answer questions like:<br /><br />
            - What is the experience like?<br />
            - What is the search like, how easy is it to
            filter my search results? What filter options are there? <br /> - How
            relevant are the doctors the app is suggesting to me?<br /> - What
            information I am being given about doctor's services? How does geotargeting look?



            <br />
            <br />I found a few solutions, amongst which is one mobile site. I included this in my research because
            I
            felt it has some excellent features and offers a great user experience! I felt that although it is not
            an
            app, it's definitely worth taking notes from these guys.
            <br />

        <img src="images/app_logos.png" style="width:50%" />


        <p style="padding-bottom: 0px;">I firstly looked at the Homescreens to understand what
            the user sees when they
            open the
            app and how the user might access the 'Search' from the Homescreen.
            <br /><br />I
            wanted to see what common features these apps had and how I could use my findings in my
            redesign.<br />

        <p style="padding-bottom: 0;">
            After having a look at the Homescreens, I began to look at the 'Search' in more detail. I highlighted some
            good and some bad features of the Search function and the Search
            Results as well as looking at interactions
            with the input fields.<br />

            <p>This is a good indicator, people are changing their behaviours and are booking appointments online rather
                than the traditional way via practice by phone. A slightly higher percentage of people are using apps
                than desktop.

                style="color: darkblue; font-size:1.75vw"></span> Some of reasons for not using an app are
            related to usability issues

        </button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Not all users are willing to use apps to complete this task, some people do not want to download extra
                apps that they only use once a year, some people have their doctors in their contacts and it's easier
                for them to call. <br />However some of the points highlighted by people who would not use apps are
                related to
                past bad experience. It was mentioned that one user wanted to find out when the
                next earliest appointment
                availability was
                which is why they called - this solution can be provided in the app.<br /> Some people prefer to speak
                to someone and hear a voice, which indicates a need for reassurance and confirmation. This is also
                something that can be solved through the app. More reassurance can be provided by the software.

        <div class="content">
            <p>To the majority of people, such an app is either unavailable or there's a lack of awareness. I found this
                to be an issue in my own research too, there were very few solutions out there available.

            process steps, complicated
            booking and payment process, frustration, lack of relevant information, accessibility

        </button>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In general people seem open to using an app to book their doc appointments but the apps out there have
                some issues. that need to be tackled - users need more accurate and more relevant info in their search
                results with information about their doctors and availability of appointments, a clearer booking process
                and a better way to store their documents.
